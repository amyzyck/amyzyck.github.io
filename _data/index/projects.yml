- name: Investigating how larval response to multiple coastal stressors shapes the distribution of genomic variation of adult oysters
#  i18n: 
  gh_user: amyzyck
  repo: EecSeq_NB_EasternOyster
  img: /static/assets/img/landing/6pops_colorcoded.pdf
  desc: A project using a seascape genomics approach to link larval oyster responses to multiple coastal stressors, adult oyster population genomics, and environmental data to determine how environmental stressors shape the adaptive divergence of wild oyster populations in Narragansett Bay, RI through selective pressures imposed on the larval stage.
- name: Evolutionary responses of oyster larvae to prominent coastal stressors 
#  i18n: 
  gh_user: amyzyck
  repo: RISG_LarvalCADO

  desc: A project using single-generation seawater manipulation experiments to investigate genomic and phenotypic responses of larval oysters to high-intensity, diel-cycling pH and dissolved oxygen exposures. 
- name: Impacts of sewage effluent on genomic diversity and connectivity of fiddler crab populations 
#  i18n: 
  gh_user: amyzyck

  desc: A project using a seascape genomics approach to determine the effects of sewage effluent on the genomic diversity and connectivity of fiddler crab populations in Corpus Christi, TX.
