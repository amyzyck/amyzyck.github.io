  desc: I am a Ph.D. student at the University of Rhode Island in the Puritz Lab of Marine Evolutionary Ecology. Broadly, I am interested in assessing evolutionary responses of benthic marine organisms to multiple anthropogenic stressors. I am using seascape genomics techniques to understand how stressors, like sewage effluent, can act as barriers to gene flow across marine populations. Additionally, I am conducting exposure experiments to investigate physiological responses of larval oysters to multiple stressors and using genomic techniques to determine the underlying mechanisms of those responses. As I believe that reproducibility is an important part of science, all protocols and code used in current and future projects can be accessed through my website or GitHub account.     # Describe yourself.
