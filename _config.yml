  desc: I am a recent Ph.D. graduate and a current postdoctoral researcher in the Puritz Lab of Marine Evolutionary Ecology at the University of Rhode Island. My research focuses on how benthic marine organisms adapt to multiple human-driven environmental stressors. During my doctoral studies, I combined seascape genomics with laboratory seawater manipulation experiments to understand how stressors, like coastal acidification and hypoxia, can impact the early life-stages of oysters  and, in turn, shape the connectivity of oyster populations. I utilized Expressed Exome Capture Sequencing (EecSeq) to identify and analyze putatively adaptive regions of the eastern oyster genome under exposure to multiple coastal stressors. By comparing adaptive responses across larval, juvenile, and adult oyster stages, I assessed the adaptive potential of oyster populations in the face of ongoing climate change. Committed to scientific rigor and transparency, I ensure all protocols and code from my current and future projects are openly available via this website and my GitHub account.
